# DM420 — Status & Open Work

> Single source of truth for **open** work. Done work is **not** tracked here — `git log` is its record. The *why* behind architecture tasks lives in `ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md`; component specs in `docs/`; the multi-op protocol in `docs/networking.md`. Owners: **J** = Josh/N0JDC, **W** = Joel/W4LL, **—** = either. _Updated 2026-06-26._

## 🔴 Field Day blockers (June 27–28)

> **The Field Day QSO machinery is built and now reachable.** The engine already sequences the full FD flow — `CQ FD …` → bare `<class> <section>` exchange → `R`-exchange → `RR73`/`73`, with the grid step skipped and the roger/`73` roles reversed (log-on-send vs. log-on-received) — plus the P1–P3 idiom fixes (give-up cap, any-sign-off completion, report-opener) and the class/section log columns. All of it is in `main` with characterization tests. **The runtime gate is now wired:** the unlocked Digital panel's CONTEST selector (`None` | `ARRL Field Day` + class/section) edits `Station`, persists to `[station]` in `config.toml`, and `to_qso_config()` pushes the chosen `ContestProfile` to the engine on re-lock. What remains is **on-air** validation, not code.

> _Cleared since last update — now in `main`, evaluated and **no longer blockers** (need **on-air** validation, not code): per-`(call,band)` dupe tracking via the single-owner `WorkedStatus` producer, with mode **deliberately collapsed** (the ARRL-correct digital rule — 20 m FT8 ⇒ dupe on 20 m FT4; supersedes the old "per-band/per-**mode**" framing); the "CQ answered with a report, not grid" drop (P3, `engine.rs:353`, correctly gated **off** in FD); the class/section log columns (`engine.rs:1191`; generic `SNT`/`RCV` columns already render the exchange string); the **Contest-mode setup UI gate** itself (CONTEST selector → `Station` → `[station]` persistence → `to_qso_config()`); and **the FD exchange encode/decode itself** — the `modes` packer now implements the ARRL-FD message type (i3 = 0.3/0.4) in `crates/modes/src/arrl_fd.rs` + `message.rs`, **validated byte-for-byte against the WSJT-X source** (`lib/77bit/packjt77.f90`): three golden-vector tests assert payload byte-identity with `ft8code`, and WSJT-X's `jt9` decodes our synthesized FD signal end-to-end in **FT8 and FT4** (our decoder reads it back to `FieldDay{class,section}`). The earlier "i3=3 / 0-based isec" framing was wrong — it is i3 = 0.3/0.4 with a **1-based** section index into the 86-entry `csec` table._

- [ ] **On-air validation of the FD QSO flow** — W/J — the FSM and the P1–P3 fixes are landed and unit-tested but have never run against real radios; reproduce/diagnose the earlier on-air symptoms against the now-landed engine. **The FD exchange encode/decode is now WSJT-X-validated off-air** (see the cleared list above — golden vectors + `jt9` round-trip), so this item is the QSO-flow timing and the live RF pipeline, **not** the message format. Subsumes the old "report not grid is ignored" item (the P3 fix is in — verify it on air) and gates on completing a real **FT4** contact (`docs/live_pipeline_notes.md`).
- [ ] **Log entries carry no FD-vs-normal tag** — — — `LogEntry` has no contest/exchange-kind field; `3A WI` vs. `-07` is only inferable by parsing the exchange string (the stored `Section` is a weak proxy). Add an explicit tag (serde-default for back-compat), set from `is_field_day()` at construction. Cheap; matters for clean export/scoring.

## Field Day Desired

- [ ] **Multi-caller auto-pick (pileups)** — J — the FD norm is several stations answering one CQ slot; auto-select the highest-SNR non-dupe, exclude calls a peer is working, highlight all answerers, and allow number-key override (`docs/qso_flow.md` §6). Not started.

- [ ] Tri-state control for clear QSY/follow station/lock offset. In "Clear" mode it would always attempt to find a clear part of the audio passband. In "Follow" it would behave as it does today--following the offset of whatever station we are answering, or using the current offset for CQ. In "Lock" it would lock to the current offset.

- [ ] Selection during scanning needs to be disabled--map and/or decode panel

- [ ] Band scan needs to publish results to network

## Weird QSO State Thing

- [ ] Picking up a QSO mid-stream by clicking on somebody's traffic (addressed to my station) appeared to have the following odd behaviors: 1) My QSO state machine switched to calling CQ after finishing that QSO, even though I did not start by calling CQ. 2) My own CQ traffic is listed with a number shortcut for answering.

## After Field Day

**Architecture rework (open)** — IDs reference `ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md`:
- [ ] **1a — close the TX-outcome loop** ⚠ *the deepest fault*: the FSM advances open-loop (`TxAck` only has `Accepted`); a denied/failed over advances like a sent one → logged contacts that never aired. Safety-adjacent.
- [ ] 1c — clock unification (wire the dead `BusView.clock`; remaining direct `Utc::now()` reads) — spectrogram drift only partly fixed
- [ ] 2c — publish `OperatingState` (the mode+band owner) + a `SessionCommand` bus path — retires the interim band-from-`RigState` workaround in the beacon
- [ ] 2b follow-through — `core::enrich` now stamps `EnrichedDecode{band, worked}` onto `decodes_enriched` (consumed by `core::band_status`). Remaining: migrate the other band-from-VFO derivations (`bus_view::pump_heard`, the `net` beacon, `core::scan`'s private `slot_band`) onto it, and have the enricher emit `origin` / `WorkedByNetwork`
- [ ] 3b — per-radio control lease (Operate | Scanning | Configuring) + operate⊥configure invariant; config off the lock edge
- [ ] 0a — derive watchdog / `max_tx` / `grant_ttl` from one `slot_period` + `debug_assert`; explicit `ForceUnkey` (the stale comments are already fixed); tighten the FT4 TX watchdog (currently runs too long, ~2 slots — non-blocking)
- [ ] 0b — wire `Granter::revoke` into the QSO-Stop / scan-cancel abort path (the method exists but is unused)
- [ ] A2 — carve the dead prototype tables (`panel_data.rs`) + the mock-only `waterslide_panel.rs`
- [ ] `draw_waterslide`'s 22 positional args → a `WaterslideView` struct (deferred from the `waterfall/` decomposition; the fn now lives in `panels/waterfall/render.rs`)
- [ ] Phase 4 — reconcile `docs/message-catalog.md` with reality (mark each topic built / delete the dead ones)

**Multi-op feature track** — see `docs/networking.md`:
- [ ] Shared logbook, full (Step 2): outbound push, inbound merge, G-set, anti-entropy digest/request/reply, origin-distinct UI
- [ ] Origin prerequisites: `origin: Mine|Peer` on the GUI `HeardEntry` / `MapSpot`; the worked producer emits `WorkedByNetwork`
- [ ] Working-intent (Step 3): the deconfliction overlay shipped; remaining = auto-pick exclusion of peers' offsets
- [ ] Heard/band aggregation (Step 4): peers' heard-stations + band-activity into the local views — `core::band_status` already merges peer `StationSnapshot.heard` (now carrying `mode`) and `HeardStation` has the field; remaining is the LAN beacon *populating* `heard` (from the producer's `Mine`-origin set) so peer rows fill
- [ ] Shared band-scan: beacon `band_activity`; show peers' scan results

**Decoder** — see `docs/decoder_*.md` (W's lane):
- [ ] Sensitivity Phase 3.1 fit + profiling

**Reliability / live pipeline** — see `docs/live_pipeline_notes.md`:
- [ ] Spectrogram ↔ decode-text drift: rebuild columns by `SpectrumRow.t` (🔴 — same fix as 1c)
- [ ] Bound the per-slot decode threads (backpressure when decode > slot duration)
- [ ] Clean capture shutdown (enables device/source switching)
- [ ] Spectrum stream sampled lossily (a `Cell`, not a ring) — drain a ring per frame
- [ ] NTP-drift detection / warning (slot timing silently depends on the system clock)
- [ ] Brightness scale hardcoded (`COL_DB_FLOOR`/`CEIL`) — add a reference-level control / AGC

## Backlog / under consideration
- [ ] **Field Day log reset** — J — no clear/truncate path exists (no `SessionCommand::ClearLog`; logbook is append-only; `ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md:271` flags `scanner.worked` growing unbounded). Needed so practice/prior QSOs don't count as dupes at contest start. Hook: a reset command → logbook archives-then-zeros + republishes an empty `logbook/entries` → the `WorkedStatus` producer and every consumer fall to empty automatically (single-owner pays off here).
- General QSO optimization. If a station calls us before we start CQ again, instead of directly answering the station we call CQ then (hopefully) they call us after that. We could just call them directly instead of calling CQ.
- Map: grid squares drawn in the wrong places
- Map: turn off crosshairs after a QSO clears; highlight a station that answers my CQ
- After a QSO finishes: unhighlight traffic + reset the Send box to CQ
- RX clipping indicator (audio level)
- Clear-lane finder: jump to an optimum CQ calling frequency (occupancy map + lane scoring) — `lane-finder` branch
- Band-scanner enhancements: per-offset sweep, FD-only filter, SNR floor, configurable dwell
- Band Status panel polish: tune the six-band grid + header SCAN-button placement once eyeballed; populate it in pure-mock mode (the producers run in real/WAV `core::spawn` only, so mock mode shows empty); rename the now-misnamed `BANDSCAN_H` constant
- Decode-archive analytics: querying, logbook recovery, whole-QSO view, SQLite, origin stamping
- Waterfall render gap on refocus (the App-Nap *unkey* is already fixed; spectrogram-freeze-on-refocus remains)
- _Design calls to settle:_ wait-for-CQ vs answer-immediately (`docs/joel/joels-notes.md`); jump on a station after their RR73; behavior when clicking another station (decode or map) while armed / mid-QSO; drop SNR from own transmissions
